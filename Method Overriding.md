# 🐟 Method Overriding-Fish and Shark Class Inheritance in Python

## 🧠 AIM:
To write a Python program that demonstrates class inheritance by creating a parent class Fish with a method type, and a child class Shark that overrides the type method.

## 📋 ALGORITHM:

1. Define the Fish class with a method named type() that prints "fish".
2. Define the Shark class as a subclass of Fish, and override the type() method to print "shark".
3. Create an instance of the Fish class named obj_goldfish.
4. Create an instance of the Shark class named obj_hammerhead.
5. Use a for loop to iterate over both objects.
6. Within the loop, call the type() method using the loop variable.
7. Output will demonstrate method overriding: printing "fish" and "shark" accordingly.

## 💻 PROGRAM:
```

class Fish:
    def type(self):
        return "I am a fish."
class Shark(Fish):
    def type(self):
        return "I am a shark, a type of fish."
fish = Fish()
print(fish.type())  # Output: I am a fish.

shark = Shark()
print(shark.type())  # Output: I am a shark, a type
```

## RESULT
The program successfully creates class inheritance
